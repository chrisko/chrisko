Make sure the CGI module is installed.
The "Failed Request Tracing" is useful, too. Logs go into "c:\inetpub\logs\FailedReqLogFiles\".

In the IIS Manager (I'm using Server Manager), add a new Site named "git".
No need to create a new Application Pool, we'll use DefaultAppPool.
In that Site's setting:
  - Change the "Bindings" to port 8080 (or whatever).
  - The "Basic Settings" should link to "c:\Users\ckoenig\Documents\src\git\gitweb".
  - That "Connect as" under "Basic Settings" should be using pass-through authentication.

In "Authentication", turn on "Windows Authentication", using HTTP 401 Challenge.
Change the "Default Document" to "gitweb.cgi". Move it to the top, or delete the others.
Under "Handler Mappings", hit "Add Wildcard Script Map" on the right.
  Matching "*", choosing the executable "c:\cygwin\bin\perl.exe gitweb.cgi %s".
  Hit that "Request Restrictions" box, too, and under "Access" check "Execute".

Permissions:
  If there's a "web.config" file, make sure the permissions are world-readable.
  Make sure gitweb is 755, and gitweb/static is 755 (with contents 644).

(If the "Handler Mappings" are all disabled, then... Panic?)

Now you should be able to hit the server, and get back HTTP 502's.
The problem is, gitweb's not returning anything. Empty headers are an error.

Enter the gitweb directory, and run "perl gitweb.cgi" to see what errors there are.
