There are some mornings where the sky looks like a road
There are some dragons who are built to have and hold
And some machines are dropped from great heights, lovingly
And some great bellies ache with many bumblebees
And they sting so terribly
  -- Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie
  -- Joanna Newsom

And I've been making promises I know I'll never keep
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep
I've got to go when the whistle blows, the whistle knows my name
Baby, I was born on a train
  -- Born on a Train
  -- The Magnetic Fields
###
When I die
Put my bones in an empty street
To remind me how it used to be
Don't write my name on stone
Bring a Coleman lantern and the radio
Cleveland game and two fishin' poles
And watch with me from the shore
Ghostly steel and iron ore
Ships coming home
  -- Blue Factory Flame
  -- Songs: Ohia

Theory has nothing to do with a work of art. Pictures which are interpretable,
and which contain a meaning, are bad pictures. A picture presents itself as the
Unmanageable, the Illogical, the Meaningless. It demonstrates the endless
multiplicity of aspects; it takes away our certainty, because it deprives a
thing of its meaning and its name. It shows us the thing in all the manifold
significance and infinite variety that preclude the emergence of any single
meaning and view.
  -- Gerhard Richter
###
The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.
  -- Edwin Schlossberg
###
Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity life
follows my pen. The days and hours of it are flying over our heads like clouds
of a windy day never to return — more every thing presses on — and every time I
kiss thy hand to bid adieu, every absence which follows it, are preludes to the
eternal separation which we are shortly to make!
  -- Tristram Shandy (1759 - 1767)
  -- Laurence Sterne
###
Most of life is so dull it is not worth discussing, and it is dull at all ages.
When we change our brand of cigarette, move to a new neighborhood, subscribe to
a different newspaper, fall in and out of love, we are protesting in ways both
frivolous and deep against the not to be diluted dullness of day-to-day living.
  -- Summer Crossing (1949)
  -- Truman Capote
###
If you reveal everything, bare every feeling, ask for understanding,
you lose something crucial to your sense of yourself.
You need to know things that others don't know.
It's what no one knows about you that allows you to know yourself.
  -- Point Omega (2010)
  -- Don DeLillo
###
The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition... Always new books,
new programs, new films, new items, but always the same meaning.
  -- Le Plaisir du Texte (1975)
  -- Roland Barthes
###
Woe to the statesman whose arguments for entering a war
are not as convincing at its end as they were at the beginning.
  -- Otto von Bismarck
###
Unhappiness is selfish, grief is selfish. For whom are the tears?
  -- Written on the Body (1992)
  -- Jeanette Winterson
###
Silicon Valley was a physical place, it extended from
Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Mountain View. Now it's a state of mind
that essentially extends from San Jose to San Francisco.
  -- Steve Blank (2011)
###
Watch your thoughts, for they become words.
Watch your words, for they become actions.
Watch your actions, for they become habits.
Watch your habits, for they become your character.
Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.
  -- Poster on some 7th grade classroom wall
###
Does one's integrity ever lie in what he is not able to do?
I think that usually it does, for free will does not mean one will,
but many wills conflicting in one man.
  -- Wise Blood (1952)
  -- Flannery O'Connor
###
Agencies, departments, and organizations don’t do things —
people do things. People’s names should be on things to
foster both accountability and pride.
  -- Edward Tufte
###
The function of science fiction is not always to predict the future
but sometimes to prevent it.
  -- Frank Herbert
###
Architecture is a small piece of this human equation, but for those of us who
practice it, we believe in its potential to make a difference, to enlighten and
to enrich the human experience, to penetrate the barriers of misunderstanding
and provide a beautiful context for life's drama.
  -- Frank Gehry
###
Cinema is higher than us, it is that to which we must lift our eyes.
  -- Jean-Luc Godard
###
Love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter
of anxious concern for the wellbeing of one's companion.
  -- Jane Eyre (1847)
  -- Charlotte Brontë
###
German language, you are your masterpiece:
love interwound in all your compound voices
and open vowels, sounds which accommodate
the studious hexameters of Greek
and undercurrents of jungles and of nights.
Once, I had you. Now, at the far extreme
of weary years, I feel you have become
as out of reach as algebra and the moon.
  -- From "To the German Language"
  -- Jorge Luis Borges
###
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill
  -- From "You Don't Know How It Feels"
  -- Tom Petty
###
While I appreciate the value of wearing a ski helmet, I am concerned about the
continuing and seemingly inexorable transfer of authority from parents to the
state. Not every human problem deserves a law.
  -- Gov. Jerry Brown (D-California)
###
There are two kinds of taste, the taste for emotions of surprise
and the taste for emotions of recognition.
  -- Henry James
###
I suppose sooner or later in the life of everyone comes a moment of trial. We
all of us have our particular devil who rides us and torments us, and we must
give battle in the end.
  -- Rebecca (1938)
  -- Daphne du Maurier
###
Never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think.
  -- Niels Bohr
###
Cryptic upperparts streaked brown, buff, and black; underparts pale with warm
wash on flanks; rump buff, tawny, or rufous. Flight: broad, pale wing stripe.

That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  -- From Sonnet 73
  -- William Shakespeare
