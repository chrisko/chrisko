There are some mornings where the sky looks like a road
There are some dragons who are built to have and hold
And some machines are dropped from great heights, lovingly
And some great bellies ache with many bumblebees
And they sting so terribly

When I die
Put my bones in an empty street
To remind me how it used to be
Don't write my name on stone
Bring a Coleman lantern and the radio
Cleveland game and two fishin' poles
And watch with me from the shore
Ghostly steel and iron ore
Ships coming home

Theory has nothing to do with a work of art. Pictures which are interpretable,
and which contain a meaning, are bad pictures. A picture presents itself as the
Unmanageable, the Illogical, the Meaningless. It demonstrates the endless
multiplicity of aspects; it takes away our certainty, because it deprives a
thing of its meaning and its name. It shows us the thing in all the manifold
significance and infinite variety that preclude the emergence of any single
meaning and view.
  -- Gerhard Richter

The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.
  -- Edwin Schlossberg
###
Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity life
follows my pen. The days and hours of it are flying over our heads like clouds
of a windy day never to return — more every thing presses on — and every time I
kiss thy hand to bid adieu, every absence which follows it, are preludes to the
eternal separation which we are shortly to make!
  -- Tristram Shandy (1759 - 1767)
  -- Laurence Sterne
###
Most of life is so dull it is not worth discussing, and it is dull at all ages.
When we change our brand of cigarette, move to a new neighborhood, subscribe to
a different newspaper, fall in and out of love, we are protesting in ways both
frivolous and deep against the not to be diluted dullness of day-to-day living.
  -- Summer Crossing (1949)
  -- Truman Capote
###
If you reveal everything, bare every feeling, ask for understanding, you lose
something crucial to your sense of yourself. You need to know things that
others don't know. It's what no one knows about you that allows you to know
yourself.

The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition... Always new books,

Art is an expression of an individual’s will to society at large.

I saw the peculiar way America creeps up on you if you don’t have anything.
It's never rude. It's just, Yes, you do have to work 14 hours. And yes, you do
have to ride the bus home. You're now the father of two and you will work in
that cubicle or you will be dishonored. Suddenly the universe was laden with
moral import, and I could intensely feel the limits of my own power. We didn't
have the money, and I could see that in order for me to get this much money, I
would have to work for this many more years. It was all laid out in front of
me, and suddenly absurdism wasn't an intellectual abstraction, it was actually
realism. You could see the way that wealth was begetting wealth, wealth was
begetting comfort – and that the cumulative effect of an absence of wealth was
the erosion of grace.

Love is the superstar of virtues, and the most watered down word in the English
language. I love this weather. I love your dress. And what we've done with this
word, we've done with this thing -- this possibility, this essential bond, this
act. We've made it private, contained it in family, when its audacity is in its
potential to cross tribal lines. We've fetishized it as romance, when its true
measure is a quality of sustained, practical care.

Here is the bread of time to come,

The imagined pine, the imagined jay.

  -- From "The Man with the Blue Guitar"

###
I was very careful right away, it was a gut instinct that I had, to keep it to
myself because I believe ideas are most vulnerable in their infancy, and it's
instinct to turn to your right or left in that moment and tell a friend, or
tell your husband, and the moment you do that ego is invited into the mix, and
then you end up spending all your time defending it, explaining it, and not
pursuing it.
  -- Sara Blakely
###
There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share with the

  -- Oscar Wilde
###
Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull,

[In response to a clergyman who hoped "the Lord was on our side."]

We received a letter from the Writers' War Board the other day asking for a
statement on "The Meaning of Democracy." It presumably is our duty to comply
with such a request, and it is certainly our pleasure.

Surely the Board knows what democracy is. It is the line that forms on the
right. It is the don't in don't shove. It is the hole in the stuffed shirt
through which the sawdust slowly trickles; it is the dent in the high hat.
Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are
right more than half of the time. It is the feeling of privacy in the voting
booths, the feeling of communion in the libraries, the feeling of vitality
everywhere. Democracy is a letter to the editor. Democracy is the score at the
beginning of the ninth. It is an idea which hasn't been disproved yet, a song
the words of which have not gone bad. It's the mustard on the hot dog and the
cream in the rationed coffee. Democracy is a request from a War Board, in the
middle of a morning in the middle of a war, wanting to know what democracy is.

As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of
truisms and stereotypes, so in our time we must move on from the reassuring
repetition of stale phrases to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation
with reality.

For the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie — deliberate,
contrived, and dishonest — but the myth — persistent, persuasive, and
unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject
all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of
opinion without the discomfort of thought.

You say to brick, "What do you want, brick?" Brick says to you,

###
Your rationalizations will give you good reasons not to do things.
Rationalization is a thing that can destroy courage, particularly when
something has to be decided. There's always a damn good reason why you

Every time you break through it I think it's easier the next time.

Will this choice enlarge me or diminish me?

For the things we have to learn before we can do, we learn by doing, e.g, men
