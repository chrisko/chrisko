There are some mornings where the sky looks like a road.
There are some dragons who are built to have and hold.
And some machines are dropped from great heights, lovingly!
And some great bellies ache with many bumblebees,
And they sting so terribly.

And I've been making promises I know I'll never keep.
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep.
I've got to go when the whistle blows, the whistle knows my name.
Baby, I was born on a train.

When I die
Put my bones in an empty street
To remind me how it used to be.
Don't write my name on stone;
Bring a Coleman lantern and the radio,
Cleveland game and two fishin' poles,
And watch with me from the shore
Ghostly steel and iron ore
Ships coming home.

Theory has nothing to do with a work of art. Pictures which are interpretable,
and which contain a meaning, are bad pictures. A picture presents itself as the
Unmanageable, the Illogical, the Meaningless. It demonstrates the endless
multiplicity of aspects; it takes away our certainty, because it deprives a
thing of its meaning and its name. It shows us the thing in all the manifold
significance and infinite variety that preclude the emergence of any single
meaning and view.
  -- Gerhard Richter

The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.

Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity life
follows my pen. The days and hours of it are flying over our heads like clouds
of a windy day never to return — more every thing presses on — and every time I
kiss thy hand to bid adieu, every absence which follows it, are preludes to the
eternal separation which we are shortly to make!
  -- Tristram Shandy
  -- Laurence Sterne

Most of life is so dull it is not worth discussing, and it is dull at all ages.
When we change our brand of cigarette, move to a new neighborhood, subscribe to
a different newspaper, fall in and out of love, we are protesting in ways both
frivolous and deep against the not to be diluted dullness of day-to-day living.
  -- Summer Crossing
  -— Truman Capote

If you reveal everything, bare every feeling, ask for understanding,
you lose something crucial to your sense of yourself.
You need to know things that others don’t know.
It’s what no one knows about you that allows you to know yourself.
  -- Point Omega
  -— Don DeLillo

The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition... Always new books,
new programs, new films, new items, but always the same meaning.
  -- Le Plaisir du Texte (1975)
